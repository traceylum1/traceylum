    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Born and raised in the East Bay. I worked abroad in Taiwan for 6 years teaching English to both 
      children and professionals in cram schools and online schools, and wrote English textbooks and 
      articles for language learners. I moved back to the Bay in 2022 and began my CS learning journey.
